RePlays is a free and open source program that automatically manages recording of detected running games, with a clip editor that allows for quick video sharing.

## Development
RePlays is powered by C# (ASP.NET Core, .NET) and Typescript (React). Typescript is used for the interface (frontend), while C# is the core of the program (backend).

The interface is displayed using Microsoft Edge WebView2. It was chosen over Electron in favor of performance, while still allowing for a web-powered interface.

The project came together as homage to [Plays.tv](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plays.tv), and is even powered by one of it's modules.

This software is not sponsored by or affiliated with Plays.tv or its affiliates.
